    Our "top pizza delivery chain" has introduced a particularly unhealthy new
    pizza, inciting controversy.
  choices:
    - Ban this pizza and "make restaurants include nutritional information on all
      of their menu items".
    - Ban fast food restaurants and require that they "pay reparations" to people
      who became obese from eating their food.
    - Decide it's not the government's business.
    - Raise taxes to fund "an aging hippie" who wants to start a healthier
      competitor to the problematic pizza chain.

    The legislature has voted down a flagship bill that I wanted passed, severely
    hampering my legislative agenda, despite my party having “a comfortable
    majority”.
  choices:
    - Maintain party discipline by having heavily-equipped security officers
      march around and personally intimidate legislators.
    - Appoint one Francis Woodheart as party whip, charged with prevailing upon
      legislators to vote per our wishes in return for favors such as political
      appointments.
    - Allow legislators to keep their votes secret, and devolve some unspecified
      authority to local governments.
    - Make legislators' voting more transparent to empower the electorate to
      recall legislators whose records they dislike.
    - Personally, publicly, and literally whip disobedient legislators.
