    Our Houses of Parliament are becoming overcrowded with politicians as the
    nation and its government grow. Shall we build a larger building elsewhere?
  choices:
    - Build a larger building in a major city, which becomes the new capital
      city. (This option unlocks the capital city field.)
    - Dispense with having a capital city at the national level. (This option
      leaves the capital city field locked.)
    - Build a whole new capital city underground, where it will be more
      defensible. (This option unlocks the capital city field.)
    - Accept a theme park tycoon's offer of retrofitting a theme park as the new
      seat of the legislature (while continuing to operate it as a theme park).
      (This option unlocks the capital city field.)
    - Cut down on the size of the government so that it will continue to fit in
      the current building. (This option leaves the capital city field locked.)

    Our "top pizza delivery chain" has introduced a particularly unhealthy new
    pizza, inciting controversy.
  choices:
    - Ban this pizza and "make restaurants include nutritional information on all
      of their menu items".
    - Ban fast food restaurants and require that they "pay reparations" to people
      who became obese from eating their food.
    - Decide it's not the government's business.
    - Raise taxes to fund "an aging hippie" who wants to start a healthier
      competitor to the problematic pizza chain.

      lavatories.
    - Do nothing.

    The legislature has voted down a flagship bill that I wanted passed, severely
    hampering my legislative agenda, despite my party having “a comfortable
    majority”.
  choices:
    - Maintain party discipline by having heavily-equipped security officers
      march around and personally intimidate legislators.
    - Appoint one Francis Woodheart as party whip, charged with prevailing upon
      legislators to vote per our wishes in return for favors such as political
      appointments.
    - Allow legislators to keep their votes secret, and devolve some unspecified
      authority to local governments.
    - Make legislators' voting more transparent to empower the electorate to
      recall legislators whose records they dislike.
    - Personally, publicly, and literally whip disobedient legislators.

    In the wake of “intense public interest” re an old map that says “Here Be
    Dragons”, we've discovered that “a disturbingly high percentage of the
    population” claims to believe in the existence of dragons.
  choices:
    - Cut funding from religion, which leads people to believe in such rubbish,
      and boost funding to education, to teach people better than that.
    - Don't blame religion, but rather crack down on “godless” and
      “anti-religious” fantasy fiction.
    - Boost funding to science and loosen regulation of biological
      experimentation such that we might be able to make dragons real.
    - Encourage belief in dragons and spread rumors that I control them, as a
      means of intimidating the populace.

    Journalists and securities analysts allege that the Minister for the

    excessive verbiage.
  choices:
    - Require official reports to use simple language.
    - Agree with the minister, who seems to vaguely say that the reports'
      impenetrability is good because it decreases market volatility.
    - Require all such “government commentary” to be rendered in legalese for
